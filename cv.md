### Code examples:

***Beginner Series #1 School Paperwork from Codewars:*** *Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages. Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.*

```
function paperwork(n, m) {
  if (n > 0 && m > 0) {
    return n * m;
  } else if (n <= 0 || m <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
} 
```
***Student's Final Grade from Codewars:*** *Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects. This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above); This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:* 
* *100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.* 
* *90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.* 
* *75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.* 
* *0, in other cases*

```
function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if (exam > 90 || projects > 10) {
    return 100;
  } else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5) {
    return 90;
  } else if (exam > 50 && projects >= 2) {
    return 75;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
